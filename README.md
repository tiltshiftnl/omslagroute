# Styling resources

The city of Amsterdam has developed a [design system](https://designsystem.amsterdam.nl/7awj1hc9f/p/39359e-design-system). Not all patterns have been built, they are built as soon as they become applicable. Ask colleagues through the OIS Slack #frontend channel.

The documentation for (React) components based on elements from the design system can be found in the [storybook](https://amsterdam.github.io/amsterdam-styled-components/?path=/story/experimental-atoms-accordion--single-accordion-with-paragraph) pages of the [Amsterdam Styled Components repository](https://github.com/Amsterdam/amsterdam-styled-components/tree/master/.storybook).
